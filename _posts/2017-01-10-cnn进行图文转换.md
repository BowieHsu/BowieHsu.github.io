## *主要应用于机器翻译与物体识别

## 1.论文的主要贡献：
---
- soft deterministic attention mechanism trainable by standard back-propagation
- hard stochastic attention mechanism trainable by maximizing an approximate variantional lower bound or equivalently by reinforce
- we show how we can gain insight and interpret the results of this framework by visualizing "where" and "what" the attention focused on
- we quantitatively validate the usefulness of attention in caption generation with state of the art performance

## 2.相关工作
---
- first approach to use neural networks for caption generation was kiros,who proposed a multimodal log-bilinear model that was biased by features from the image
- all of those works represent images as a single feature vector from the top layer of a pre-trained convolutional network.\
- prior to the use of neural networks for generating captions, two main approaches were dominant:\
- 1.the first involved generating caption templates which were filled in based on the results of object detections and attribute discovery\
- 2.the second approach was based on first retrieving similar captioned images from a large database then modifying these retrieved captions to fit the query.

## 3.使用 attention 机制进行图像语义生成

### 3.1 使用Convolutional features进行编码

- our model takes a single raw image and generates a caption y encoded as a sequence of 1-of-K encoded words.
- In order to obtain a correspondence between the feature vectors and portions of the 2-D image, we extract features from a lower convolutional layer unlike previous work which instead used a fully connected layer.

### 4.1 Stochastic "Hard" Attention

We represent the location variable st as where the model decides to focus attention when generating the t(th) word.
st,i is an indicator one-hot variable which is set to 1 if the i-th location is the one used to extract visual features.
